When you run the current application and input http://localhost:8080/greeting, it will return {"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}

Please implement the below REST API:

URL: http://localhost:8080/user

Body: {"id": ???}
  // ??? is a number like 123, 12

Method: POST

Return: {"id": 123, "name": "Tom"}

Finish the above function based on the current framework.

The main work should be controller and Service, Unit test would be optional.

Controller -> UserService -> dao (having been finished)
